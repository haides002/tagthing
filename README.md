# Todo
- [ ] maybe save the images as bytes in the file struct (with an enum) because that means we won't have to read from disk on every button click
- [ ] thumbnailing
- [ ] no segfaulting
- [ ] make dates work
- [ ] make images square

- maybe making user-set time formats to parse self or camera named pictures if
  there is no metadata?
- TagCache needs to delete tags if all instances of these tags have been deleted
